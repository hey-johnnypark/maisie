> Baby activity tracking app for iOS

As new dad I learned a lot about babies and especially what things you need to keep a record of. The idea to this app came to me watching my partner writing down things like nappy changes or feeding times. Because there are many sleepless nights I decided to learn a new language ( Swift ) and build an open source app for iOS. Just for fun :)
